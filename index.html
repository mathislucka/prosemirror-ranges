                This editor uses plugins to track range shaped information. Range shaped information can be comments or
                some form of highlighting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ranges are represented as marks. However, a single mark can't represent a range when it contains multiple block nodes with
                inline content. Each block node's content will get a mark. In order to allow ranges across block nodes, a plugin keeps track
                of all the marks sharing a common attribute. Some utility function calculates the range which is covered by marks with the
                same attribute.
            </p>
            <p><span data-range="some-range" data-pm-id="some-id">Ranges can be confirmed. A range which is not confirmed has a lightblue background.</span></p>
            <p><span data-range="some-other-range" data-range-confirmed="true" data-pm-id="some-other-id">A range which is confirmed has a gray background.</span></p>
            <p>
                To create a new range, select some text which is not part of a range already. A tooltip will appear which lets you create a new
                range spanning the selected text.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes, a range needs to be extended or shortened. To move a range's boundaries, drop into range editing mode, click on one
                of the blue circles and then move the cursor to the place where the new boundary should be. When you're done adjusting a boundary
                click on the (red) circle again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two callbacks can be provided when initializing the plugin. One will be called whenever a range changes. It will contain the
                current and previous state of all ranges within the document. The second callback is called whenever the edit mode is triggered,
                it receives the range currently being edited. 
            </p>
