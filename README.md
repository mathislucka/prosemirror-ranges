# Prosemirror ranges

This is a proof of concept for the representation of range shaped information in prosemirror. It uses marks to represent ranges. Range boundaries can be adjusted.

This is not intended to be used as a library. Concepts used here should merely serve as an inspiration for devs trying to implement a similar use case.
